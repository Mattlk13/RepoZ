The pkgproject file needs Whitebox Packages to compile:
 - http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html

Check whether the files to deploy on macOS did change because they are all listed in the .pkgproj file by their names.
The reason is that without listing them explicitly (just the parent folder), it is not possible to grant exec permissions to grr and grrui.

Open Packages, select the project on the left, select tab "Payload" and re-add RepoZ-CLI. Expand the node and grant access to exec grr and grrui.
